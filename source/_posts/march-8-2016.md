title: No monitor recognition and a surprise reboot

Came in this morning and turned on the Surface Book (power button on top).  As I have come to expect lately, the external monitors are not recognized.  But worse this time was that the Surface still thought they were there so it was displaying all my windows on those monitors.  I tried to unplug the dock a few times unsuccessfully so I unplugged the dock and pressed the power button once.  My thinking was that maybe if it sleeps without the dock and wakes up without it, then it will know there are no monitors.  But... instead I got a surprise reboot- work lost.
